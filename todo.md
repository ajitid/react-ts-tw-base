- if upgrading to react 19, use react compiler and add eslint plugin for it (see react conf keynote)
  - use react router v7 alongwith swr (see @shuding\_ tweets)
- see if you need to use any of these new TS rules (or if they're automatically imported with current config)
- Vite recommends additional set of eslint rules, [see readme](./README.md)
